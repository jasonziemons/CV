      <p class="inline_p" > Hello! and welcome to my website CV,
        if you didnt see from the animation above my name is Jason Ziemons and I am an Electrical engineer from the University of the Witwatersraand in South Africa.
        I created this website to not only sneak in a little bit more information that I couldn't quite fit into my actual CV but to also try and give you a better understanding of who I am
        as a person. Through this I hope to share with you some of my interests, hobbies, goals and hopefully show you why I will be a good fit for your company.
        <br /><br />
        If I may ask one favour beforehand, I was learning how to do front-end development as I was creating this website so if you notice any issues at all
        please feel free to send me a email or give me a call even if it is just to tell me you hate the colour scheme, I would love to hear any feedback on how I can improve.
        <br /><br />
        Thank you for taking the time to look around.
      </p>

      <p class="inline_p" style>Eager to gain an entry-level position within a technical engineering field in order to start establishing
          myself in the workplace environment and obtain new skill sets. I am Interested in utilizing analytical
          methods, design software and programming languages in order to solve complex problems. I express
          a fondness towards physically creating tangible circuits as well as implementing the control software
          behind them. In my career, I would like to further progress my skills as an engineer but more
          importantly obtain new skills that I can use to enhance my personal development.

          Eager to gain an entry-level position within a technical engineering field in order to start establishing
          myself in the high/medium voltage workplace environment. I am Interested in entering the world of
          renewable energy and developing myself and skills in a place that I have always expressed a fondness
          towards. I want to achieve a deep understanding of high voltage applications in a technical design
          capacity as well as the physical systems used. In this I would like to further progress my skills as an
          electrical engineer but more importantly obtain new skills and understandings that I can use to
          progress and enhance my personal development as an engineer.
